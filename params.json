Prud’homme connected interdisciplinary teams to create an ambitious new set of installations using the game cabinet as a springboard for an experimental workshop process. The works by this Edmonton ad-hoc collective explore the act of participation within unusual stagings as a vehicle for disarming experiences and self-reflection\r\n\r\n### Artist Statement\r\nWe can never fully comprehend what another person is thinking, and the reasoning behind their actions. This lack of knowledge can influence our understanding of others. Without realizing it, we make assumptions based upon how they look and act. This prejudice is especially true within virtual spaces such as the internet, smartphones and video games. We have no physical ques to aid in our interpretation of another's actions. Instead of considering why someone acts the way they do we take it at face value, especially when said actions do not correspond with our personal experiences.\r\n\r\nThe game _Miscommunication_ reproduces this setting, creating a situation in which assumptions are made about a persons character soley upon their appearances and actions. The players must step away from the virtual world and start a conversation with their fellow player in order to communicate the reasons behind their actions. By communicating with each other the players complete the game.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay mimics the confusion and frustration that comes from being ignorant of what motivates another persons actions. In our game two players with independent screens find themselves in conflict with one another as they unknowingly undo each others actions while trying to reach their own objective. This illustrates how each persons actions can be misinterpreted if taken at face value. _Miscommunication_ highlights the importance of checking in with others to resolve misunderstandings and to share each persons motives. Only by conversing and being cooperative can both players truly achieve the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nArt and design by Leeanne Johnston    \r\nProgrammed by Aaron Krebs (@a-krebs) and Sabrina Gannon (@sganondorf)   \r\nSound by Adam Bignell   \r\nProject managed by Deanna Dombrowski\r\n\r\n",
